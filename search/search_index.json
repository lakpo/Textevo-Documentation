It is mainly useful to break down text animation letters by letters, words by words or lines by lines. Textevo automatically adds a text animation group and a control effect: The \"strength\" parameter is used to adjust the overall intensity of the effect. You will animate it to your liking and the instances (letters, words, lines) of the text will follow with the delay you have set. You can add as many textevo effects on your text layer. You will be able to animate your texts with a lot of freedom, to add arrival and departure movements as well as intermediate animations. What's new ? A light and flexible interface An effect grouping the main parameters Ability to stack effects for more freedom More animation directions ( random , outwards , inwards etc... ) A preset system And lots of other little options About !

The textevo controls have been combined in a pseudo effect : Strength This parameter controls the intensity of textevo. This is the parameter you need to animate if you want to add motion to your text. You have the possibility to add bounce expressions, elasticity, wiggle, sinusoid etc... (work with duik , ease an wizz and your favorite scripts). Direction You have a choice of different directions of animation : From index This parameter works with the \"from index\" direction and allows you to choose from which index the animation starts. Random seed This parameter works with the \"random\" direction. Changing the Seed value will result in entirely different random values. Transform Gives access to the different transformation properties. These properties affect the text relatively. They are directly impacted by the \"strength\" parameter. Example: If you have set the Y position to 100 and the strength is 50%, your text will only be affected by 50 px on Y. Style Works like the transform but with different properties","title":"Controls"},{"location":"controls/#controls","text":"This version of textevo has been designed to be simple.
