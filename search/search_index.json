It is mainly useful to break down text animation letters by letters, words by words or lines by lines. Textevo automatically adds a text animation group and a control effect: The \"strength\" parameter is used to adjust the overall intensity of the effect. You will animate it to your liking and the instances (letters, words, lines) of the text will follow with the delay you have set. You can add as many textvo effects on your text layer. You will be able to animate your texts with a lot of freedom, to add arrival and departure movements as well as intermediate animations. What's new ?
